# Instructions

1. Find the implicit boolean coercions and take note of them.

2. Find the implicit string <-> number coercions and take note of them.

3. Make corrections (either using implicit or explicit coercions) to the boolean and numeric operations, so that the `console.log()` statement prints out the correct output. Pay close attention to the values.

4. Why did you choose implicit vs. explicit coercion in various places? What are the tradeoffs?
