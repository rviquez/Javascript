# Instructions

1. Try at least 3 different combinations of CSS selectors/approaches to select and operate on only the two <em> elements in our example.

2. What do you notice about the readability and maintainability of these different selector approaches?

3. What observations can you make about how the different approaches will behave performance-wise (assuming of course a much larger and more complex/realistic DOM).
